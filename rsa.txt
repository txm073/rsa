p and q are two random prime numbers (the larger the numbers the more secure)
p = 89
q = 67

n = 89 * 67
m = 88 * 66
m = number of coprimes of n

d is a manually generated number
d < m and also a coprime of m
e is a number where (e * d) % m = 1

x is a random negative integer
(d * e) + (x * m) = 1
e and x are unknown values, this equation is to find e
